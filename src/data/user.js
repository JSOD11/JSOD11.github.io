		title: "About me",
		description:
			"I am a software engineer at Datadog in New York City. I graduated from Harvard with a 3.97 GPA and concentrated in computer science with a secondary in mathematics and a citation in Spanish. Alongside my bachelor's, I concurrently received a master's degree in computer science by taking enough graduate-level courses during undergrad to complete the master's program. I went to Westwood High School in my suburban hometown of Westwood, MA.",
