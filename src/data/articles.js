							I grew up in the small suburban town of Westwood, Massachusetts.
							<br></br><br></br>
							My mother is the Assistant Headmaster at East Boston High School and immigrated to the United States as a child from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Her parents both grew up in Buenos Aires, and 3 of her grandparents are originally from Spain. Her other grandparent was born in Buenos Aires, but his parents both came to Argentina as Jewish immigrants from an area of Eastern Europe called Bessarabia, which no longer exists. The area is now somewhere in the region of Moldova, Ukraine, and Romania. More information on this side of my family is documented under the journal entry "My Mother's Side."
							<br></br><br></br>
							My father is a music teacher at the Otis Elementary school in East Boston. His mother is from London, England, and his father was born in the United States as the son of Eleanor Starbuck, a descendant of the Starbuck whaling family, originally based in Nantucket. Myself, my father, and I all share the middle name Starbuck as an homage. More information on this side of my family is documented under the journal entry "My Father's Side."

							Fun Facts
						</div>
						<div className="body-text">
							Here are a number of interesting, odd, unusual, or mildly amusing facts about me. I feel like it is time I write these down before I forget or lose track of what is true:
							<br></br><br></br>
							<b>1) My great grandmother on my mother's side was a leader on the communist side of the Spanish civil war</b>. She also scored #1 in Spain on a nationwide examination, was friends with the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda, and was sentenced to death by hanging before escaping to Argentina by boat. See the journal entry "My Mother's Side" for more.
							<br></br><br></br>
							<b>2) My middle name is Starbuck.</b> On my father's side, my sixth great grandfather was the Nantucket whaler Joseph Starbuck. The book Moby Dick was written about whalers in this area and included a character named Starbuck as a reference to members of the Starbuck family in Nantucket. The founder of Starbucks Coffee chose to name the company after that character from Moby Dick, which was his favorite book, and the company logo is a siren because the founders liked the image while looking through old marine books. See the journal entry "My Father's Side" for more.
							<br></br><br></br>
							<b>3) My great grandfather on my father's side was named Harry Potter.</b> His full name was Harold Radford Potter, and he went by Harry. He lived in England.
							<br></br><br></br>
							<b>4) The "Mayhem Like Me" guy in the Allstate commercials is my second cousin (through marriage).</b> His name is Dean Winters.
							<br></br><br></br>
							<b>5) My great uncle on my mother's side was the famous Spanish comedian Jos√© Luis Coll.</b>
							<br></br><br></br>
							<b>6) My grandfather on my mother's side traveled frequently for his work and decorated his house with over a thousand small owl figurines collected from across the globe.</b> Side note: I now need to find somewhere to put over a thousand small owl figurines.
							<br></br><br></br>
							<b>7) My third cousin, Sean O'Dwyer, was the recording engineer for the Blink-182 album <i>Enema of the State</i> featuring the hit "All The Small Things."</b>
